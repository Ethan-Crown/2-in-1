# 8-bit Simulation Game

A simulation where 10 agents control 8-bit bodies, communicate via vision/audio, answer hypothetical questions, rate each other, and evolve through elimination and sexual reproduction. Visualized in a web dashboard.

- Agents communicate with flashing (vision) and whistling (audio).
- Every round, agents answer a question and rate each other.
- The bottom 5 are eliminated; top scorers reproduce to keep the population at 10.
- Offspring blend names and 8-bit characteristics from parents.
- Dashboard shows all communication, answers, ratings, eliminations, and offspring.
