## Vision
A project to pursue superintelligence—systems that can reason, learn, and act beyond human capabilities—by combining:

- **Input (sight + sound):** Multimodal data ingestion (images, audio, etc.)
- **Multimodal reasoning:** Integration of VITA and external APIs for advanced perception and understanding
- **Agent layer:** Autonomous decision-making using frameworks like AutoGPT and Darwin-core
- **Evolving actions:** Continuous improvement through code and data feedback loops (Darwinian evolution)

This architecture aims to create a self-improving, multimodal agent capable of complex reasoning and adaptive behavior.
